Abstract
Quantum computing holds the promise of solving classes of problems that are intractable for classical machines, particularly in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science. However, the current generation of quantum hardware operates under noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Users who access public devices face long waiting queues, frequent job rejections, and hardware-induced failures, all of which waste valuable time and computational effort. Although IBM Quantum provides cloud-based access to a variety of backends, it does not currently offer a single integrated dashboard that presents a holistic view of backend performance.
This work introduces a Quantum Backend Dashboard, a unified interface that consolidates real-time backend and job statistics. The tool reports metrics such as qubit count, queue length, job acceptance and rejection rates, and average execution time. With these insights, users can make more informed decisions regarding backend selection, thereby improving efficiency and increasing the probability of successful job completion. Looking ahead, the dashboard can be extended to include predictive modeling, historical workload analytics, and support for multiple quantum providers, further broadening its impact on research and education.

1. Introduction
Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm that leverages quantum mechanical principles 


such as superposition and entanglement to perform computations that classical systems cannot achieve efficiently. While classical computers encode information in binary bits (0 or 1), quantum computers operate using qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This unique property enables them to explore a vast solution space in parallel, making quantum computing attractive for domains like cryptography, drug discovery, and machine learning.
IBM Quantum has played a pioneering role in democratizing access to quantum devices by offering cloud-based backends ranging from software simulators to real superconducting quantum processors. Students, researchers, and developers can design circuits using Qiskit and run experiments on publicly available devices. However, as the number of available backends grows, users often struggle to determine the optimal choice for their experiments.
1.1 Problem Statement
While IBM Quantum provides access to diverse devices, obtaining a comprehensive view of backend performance remains difficult. Essential indicators such as queue length, error rates, average computation time, or job acceptance probability are spread across multiple interfaces and require direct API queries. This demands coding effort, repeated requests, and advanced technical familiarity, creating barriers for newcomers. As a result, users may submit jobs to suboptimal backends, leading to long delays or failures.
The absence of a unified, real-time visualization framework complicates backend selection and often results in wasted resources. A centralized dashboard that aggregates live metrics would improve accessibility and resource efficiency, while enhancing the overall user experience.
1.2 Motivation
The selection of a backend is not a trivial detail—it can determine the success or failure of an experiment. Algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) are highly sensitive to device performance. Long queues or noisy qubits can invalidate results and significantly slow progress.
For students and beginners, these challenges are even more pronounced. Many struggle to interpret raw backend data or write scripts to parse API outputs. The trial-and-error method of choosing devices often discourages exploration. A student-friendly dashboard that displays backend metrics in real time would reduce this burden, making experimentation smoother and more engaging.
From an educational perspective, such a tool also functions as a learning aid. Students can visualize how hardware reliability, qubit connectivity, or queue congestion affect performance. For researchers, it serves as a decision-support tool for allocating workloads strategically, saving both time and resources.
1.3 Contribution
This paper presents the design and implementation of a Quantum Backend Dashboard that consolidates live backend information into a unified interface. Unlike fragmented monitoring tools or API-dependent workflows, this system is designed to be accessible for both students and researchers.
Key contributions include:
Aggregation of device characteristics (qubit counts, connectivity maps, gate fidelities).
Visualization of real-time performance indicators such as queue length, average execution time, and device availability.
Monitoring of job acceptance/rejection rates to identify reliable backends.
A modular design that supports extension toward predictive analytics and cross-platform monitoring.
By integrating these features, the dashboard enhances usability, reduces wasted effort, and lowers the barrier to entry for quantum computing experimentation.
1.4 Organization
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
Section 2 reviews related work and existing monitoring tools.
Section 3 describes the methodology, including system architecture, data acquisition, processing, and visualization.
Section 4 presents results and practical use cases.
Section 5 concludes with key findings and directions for future development.

2. Related Work
IBM Quantum provides basic monitoring via Qiskit and the IBM Quantum Lab interface. Users can check if a backend is online, view calibration data, and monitor job queues. While helpful, these tools offer only device-specific perspectives without system-wide aggregation.
Qiskit’s job_monitor utility allows tracking of individual jobs, reporting status updates such as queued, running, or completed. However, it does not provide broader performance insights like historical acceptance rates or average queue times.
Research studies have analyzed backend performance, often focusing on scheduling optimizations or error characterization. These studies rely on private datasets or simulations and do not result in tools accessible to the wider community.
Community-driven visualization projects exist, but they are typically limited in scope—displaying only a single metric or supporting a single backend. A comprehensive, real-time system that integrates multiple metrics across all public devices is still missing, motivating this work.

3. Methodology
3.1 System Overview
The dashboard follows a three-layer modular design: 
           
                       Workflow overview

Data Acquisition – Collects backend and job statistics using IBM Quantum APIs.
Data Processing – Cleans, aggregates, and computes derived metrics.
Visualization – Displays insights in an interactive interface with charts and tables.
This modularity allows scalability: new metrics, backends, or providers can be integrated without major redesign.
    
3.2 Data Acquisition
The first stage of the system focuses on acquiring raw data from IBM Quantum. This is implemented using Python SDKs (Qiskit + IBM Quantum API) wrapped inside a Django REST service. The acquisition module periodically calls endpoints to fetch three broad categories of information:
1.	Backend Metadata – Properties such as the number of qubits, connectivity graph, basis gates, device type (simulator vs hardware), and current operational status are retrieved. These fields establish the static characteristics of each backend.
2.	Job Statistics – Every submitted job has metadata: submission timestamp, queue position, execution duration, final result status (success, failed, running, in queue). Capturing this repeatedly allows time-series tracking of workload.
3.	Performance Indicators – Aggregated system statistics such as acceptance/rejection counts, throughput, and queue depth are recorded to highlight backend behavior in operational terms.
The acquisition runs in scheduled cycles (every 2–5 minutes using Django Celery workers). Although the current prototype employs polling, the framework supports upgrading to WebSocket streaming to push events in real time when supported by the IBM API.
3.3 Data Processing
Raw API responses are transformed into structured, analysis-ready records. This stage executes inside Django background tasks, which standardize the information before persisting it to the PostgreSQL datastore.
Cleaning and Validation: Duplicate job entries are removed by checking unique job IDs. Timestamps are normalized to UTC. Missing fields (e.g., queue length not reported) are filled with default placeholders, enabling uniform queries downstream.
Aggregation and Derived Metrics: After cleaning, higher-level statistics are generated:
 
Representation showing some Derived Metrics    
 
•	Throughput Efficiency – Jobs completed per backend per hour, allowing fair comparison between small and large systems.
•	Failure Probability – Ratio of failed to total jobs, segmented by backend, giving a reliability estimate.
•	Effective Utilization Rate – Share of time each backend spends executing jobs versus idle or maintenance.
•	Normalized Qubit Efficiency – Average job success per qubit, offering insight into scalability.
•	User Load Balance – Distribution of submitted jobs per user region (if API provides metadata), showing where demand originates.
•	Average Execution Time per Backend – Mean runtime of successful jobs over sliding windows.

All these derivatives are stored in a dedicated metrics table, so that the visualization layer only queries processed results instead of raw logs. This separation keeps the frontend fast and scalable.

3.4 Visualization Layer
The final stage is an interactive web dashboard built using React.js (frontend) integrated with Django REST APIs (backend).
Core Views: Tabular layouts provide instant access to backend parameters. Graphical elements—such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts (via libraries like Chart.js or Recharts)—highlight queue lengths, error rates, and execution distributions.
Color-coded Indicators: Assigns colors (green, yellow, red) to backends depending on current load and error probability. This makes it possible to identify at a glance which device is optimal to target.

Historical Analysis: Interactive charts allow filtering by time range (last 24h, 7d, 1m). These reveal cyclical workload patterns—e.g., surges during hackathon weekends or quiet periods at night.
Derived Insight Panels: Special widgets display secondary insights:
•	"Most Reliable Backend This Week" (lowest failure probability).
•	"Fastest Queue Today" (shortest rolling queue time).
•	"Best Qubit Efficiency" (normalized success per qubit).
•	"Throughput Leaderboard" (highest jobs/hour backend).
Interactivity and Filtering. End-users can apply filters by device type (simulator vs hardware), qubit size ranges, or error tolerance thresholds. Combined with search and sorting, this converts a large pool of data into actionable, customized recommendations.

4. Results and Discussion
As this work is currently at the design and development stage, a full prototype has not yet been deployed. However, the proposed system is expected to provide several advantages once implemented.
First, by aggregating backend metadata and job statistics into a unified dashboard, users will be able to observe backend availability, queue lengths, and performance characteristics in real time. This is anticipated to reduce the overhead of querying multiple APIs and streamline backend selection.
Second, the dashboard is designed to highlight trade-offs between different devices, such as queue size versus execution success rate. This would help users—particularly hackathon participants and early learners—make informed choices when submitting jobs.
Finally, planned future testing will involve deploying the dashboard across selected IBM Quantum backends and collecting feedback from users. This evaluation will allow measurement of improvements in decision-making efficiency and overall user experience.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
This work presented a unified dashboard for monitoring IBM Quantum backends and job statistics. By aggregating live metrics into a single interface, the system improves transparency, reduces wasted time, and aids both students and researchers in making informed backend choices.
Key findings include:
•	Backend performance is highly dynamic, requiring continuous monitoring.
•	Queue length and acceptance rate are strong predictors of successful execution.
•	Visualizing these indicators empowers users to balance workload efficiency with reliability.
Future extensions include:
1.	Predictive Analytics – Forecasting queue wait times and rejection probabilities.
2.	Multi-Platform Support – Integrating providers beyond IBM Quantum.
3.	Advanced User Features – Alerts, customizable dashboards, and offline analysis.
Ultimately, tools like this contribute to democratizing quantum computing by making advanced resources accessible and understandable for a broader community.
